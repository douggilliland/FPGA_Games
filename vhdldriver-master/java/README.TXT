JAVA program used to type out long repatative code.

used in the "pong" VHDL file when declaring variables.

there could be a million better ways to make a program to do this in java, aka write to a file, chose the repeated words and 
where to add the changing variable in the name (ex: Box1, Box2, Box3 ... Box457)
