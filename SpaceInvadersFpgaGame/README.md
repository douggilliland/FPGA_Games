# Space Invaders Fpga Game

This two person project was completed through the course of Embedded Systems
at the University of Thessaly, Department of Computer Engineering. 

In the context of this game we implemented the classic space invaders game 
using a zedboard fpga. The project consists of 3 parts. First the connection
with the monitor through the vga interface, the game logic and the sprite memory modules.
