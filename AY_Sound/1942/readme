Instructions to play Capcom's 1942 music with a Verilog simulator:


1. Dump rom sr-01.c11 from Capcom's 1942 arcade board
2. Compile and run "dump.cc" program to convert the binary file to hexadecimal format
3. Place file in ../rom folder (see 1942.v file for details on location)
4. Run verilog simulation from 1942 folder using the "gather" file

  $ iverilog -s sound1942 -f gather -o sound1942 && vvp sound1942 > sim.log

5. Pass the output of the simulation through "log2wav.cc", either using a pipe or storing it on a file. Check that the data dump is caught correctly by log2wav as some simulators will add extra information at the beginning of the file

Other:

-tv80 project files are expected to be in ../tv80
-the music code played can be changed in 1942.v
-you may need to adjust the length of the simulation to listen the full song
