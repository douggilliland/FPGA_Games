# Space-Invaders
 An all time classic when it comes to games. The code was written as a course working during an exchange semester with a course partner. The work programming was done 100% by ourselves and we coded the game together. Our approach was to try it on our own at home and come together, take the best coding strategies and merge it to a functional code which worked out great.
