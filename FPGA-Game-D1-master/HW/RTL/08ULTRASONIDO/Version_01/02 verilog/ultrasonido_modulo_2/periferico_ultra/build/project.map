WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net divisorfrecd0/CLKOUTD is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    22 out of  15,850    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           66
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            11 out of      66   16%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              40 out of 126,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
