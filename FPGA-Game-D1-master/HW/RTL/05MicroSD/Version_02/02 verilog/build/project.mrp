  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

WARNING:Pack:2548 - The register "shd/dezd_7_1" has the property IOB=TRUE, but
   was not packed into the ILOGIC component. 
WARNING:Pack:2912 - The LUT-1 inverter "df/sclkn_BUFG_LUT1_INV_0" failed to join
   the "OLOGICE2" comp matched to output buffer "sclk_OBUF".  This may result in
   suboptimal timing.  The LUT-1 inverter df/sclkn_BUFG_LUT1_INV_0 drives
   multiple loads.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
