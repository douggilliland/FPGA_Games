  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "miso" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "miso" is not constrained (LOC) to a specific
   location.
WARNING:Pack:2912 - The LUT-1 inverter "sd/driver/sclk_INV_44_o1_INV_0" failed
   to join the "OLOGICE2" comp matched to output buffer "sclk_OBUF".  This may
   result in suboptimal timing.  The LUT-1 inverter
   sd/driver/sclk_INV_44_o1_INV_0 drives multiple loads.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <cpu0/Mram_dstack1_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <cpu0/Mram_dstack2_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB ss is either not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
   I/O Standard.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB miso is either not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
   I/O Standard.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB mosi is either not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
   I/O Standard.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB sclk is either not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
